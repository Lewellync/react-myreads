# MyReads Project

This is my submission for Project 01 (MyReads) of Udacity's React Nanodegree. This application allows users to organize a set of books provided by Udacity's API into 3 shelves, adding, moving, and removing them as the user sees fit.

The largest deviation from the rubric is that I do not show a checkmark next to the shelf of a book in search; instead I outline books that are on a shelf and if the dropdown is clicked, the shelf that book is on is highlighted.

## Installation

To get the application up and running:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the application server with `npm start`
